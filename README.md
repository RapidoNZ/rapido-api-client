# Rapido API Client

Rapido API Client is a comprehensive TypeScript client library generated by the OpenAPI Generator. It provides a structured and type-safe way to interact with the Accredo Web Service (API version 5.0.11.125), which covers a wide range of services including accounts payable (AP), accounts receivable (AR), bank and cash book operations (CB), fixed assets (FA), general ledger (GL), inventory control (IC), and many more.

> **Note:** This client library is auto-generated. Manual changes made directly to the generated source files may be overridden when the client is regenerated.

## Project Description

Rapido API Client was created to simplify integration with the Accredo Web Service. By leveraging an extensive set of API endpoints, developers can perform operations such as managing AP allocations, AR transactions, bank reconciliations, asset management, and much more—all within a TypeScript environment. The library groups endpoints into modules (e.g., AP, AR, CB, etc.) and provides helper functions and models which enforce type safety and consistent interaction with the underlying API.

## Installation

To get started with Rapido API Client, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rapido-api-client.git

# Change directory to the project folder
cd rapido-api-client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# (Optional) Build the project if using TypeScript
npm run build
```

If the client is available as an npm package, you can also install it via npm:

```bash
npm install rapido-api-client
```

## Usage Examples

Here is a basic example of how to use the client library in your project:

```typescript
import { Configuration, ApAllocationApi } from 'rapido-api-client';

// Set up your API configuration (basePath, authentication, etc.)
const config = new Configuration({
  basePath: 'https://api.example.com',
  // Add authentication or other settings as needed
});

// Instantiate an API client. For example, to work with Accounts Payable Allocation:
const apAllocationApi = new ApAllocationApi(config);

// Example: Fetch AP allocation data (replace `getApAllocation` with the actual method name)
apAllocationApi.getApAllocation()
  .then(response => {
    console.log('AP Allocation Data:', response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching AP allocation:', error);
  });
```

To execute scripts or SQL commands via the provided endpoints, you can import and use the corresponding modules:

```typescript
import { executeScript, executeSql } from 'rapido-api-client';

// Execute a custom script
executeScript({ script: 'YOUR_SCRIPT_HERE' })
  .then(response => console.log('Script executed:', response))
  .catch(error => console.error('Script error:', error));

// Execute a raw SQL query
executeSql({ query: 'SELECT * FROM your_table' })
  .then(response => console.log('SQL executed:', response))
  .catch(error => console.error('SQL error:', error));
```

## API Documentation

The client library exposes a rich set of API endpoints available under the `src/apis` directory. Each API module corresponds to a specific aspect of the Accredo Web Service (e.g., `apbudget-api`, `artransaction-api`, `settings-api`, etc.).

For full details on the available endpoints, their parameters, and the corresponding response models, please refer to the OpenAPI specification document that was used to generate this client. Additional inline code documentation is provided throughout the source files.

## Configuration Options

The main configuration settings can be found in the `src/configuration.ts` file. When initializing the client, you can set various options such as:

- **basePath**: The base URL for the API.
- **Authentication credentials**: API keys, tokens, or other authentication mechanisms as supported by the service.
- **Timeouts and Headers**: Customize request timeouts or add custom headers.

These options are passed into a shared `Configuration` object, which is then used to initialize the individual API modules.

## Dependencies

This project requires Node.js (version 10 or higher) and npm. The library is written in TypeScript and may rely on the following (among other) dependencies which are automatically installed with `npm install`:

- TypeScript
- Axios (or another HTTP client, depending on your generated configuration)
- Other type definitions and helper libraries as specified in the project’s `package.json`

## Contributing

Contributions to Rapido API Client are welcome! However, please note that since this library is auto-generated by the OpenAPI Generator, manual modifications to generated files may be overwritten. If you find issues or have suggestions related to the generator configuration or improvements in documentation:

1. Open an issue on the GitHub repository.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
3. Submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
